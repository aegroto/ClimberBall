2. Set a JME android project. You may want to use these:

  https://github.com/Nehon/bootmonkey

Complete the template your Android SDK location and everything you could need to run this basic android project.
3. Copy all the files into this repo in the root folder of the basic project you just set up. This should make the trick.
